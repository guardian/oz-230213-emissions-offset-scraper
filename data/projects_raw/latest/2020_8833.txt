a. within 48 hours following clearing of suitable nesting hollows, notify the Department in writing of the number of cleared suitable nesting hollows for black cockatoos.
b. within 30 days following completion of the action, notify the Department in writing if no suitable nesting hollows for black cockatoos were cleared.
c. install, in accordance with the artificial nesting hollow installation guidelines, at least three artificial nesting hollows for each suitable nesting hollow cleared, prior to the next breeding season.
d. install the artificial nesting hollows in a location approved in writing by DBCA.
e. implement the artificial nesting hollows and ensure that each installed artificial nesting hollow is monitored and maintained in accordance with the artificial nesting hollow maintenance guidelines for ten years from installation, with maintenance actions undertaken before the commencement of each breeding season.
f. not install artificial nesting hollows in a manner that requires additional clearing of foraging and potential breeding habitat for black cockatoos or within 10 metres of the edge of the road seals or buildings, to reduce the risk of vehicle strike and human disturbance.
g. ensure that each installed artificial nesting hollow is inspected at least twice each year, and at least four weeks apart, by a suitably qualified field ecologist during the breeding season for ten years from installation of the artificial nesting hollow to record any evidence of use by black cockatoos.
h. continue to maintain the artificial nesting hollows until a suitably qualified field ecologist verifies in writing that at least one artificial nesting hollow has shown evidence of black cockatoo nesting for three consecutive years.5/10/202105

These must be published within 60 days of a suitably qualified field ecologist providing verification as required under Condition 3 or within 25 business days after submitting the assessment report required under Condition 4.b.
