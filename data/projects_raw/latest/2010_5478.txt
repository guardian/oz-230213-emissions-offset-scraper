4. The person taking the action must submit to the Minister for approval a Malleefowl offset strategy (the strategy) for the management of the Malleefowl offset area (Attachment 4), to offset impacts resulting from the loss of Malleefowl habitat. The strategy must, at a minimum:

detail management measures to:

reduce goat and rabbit numbers;
undertake appropriate fire regimes; and
control predators (control measures will probably need to extend beyond the boundaries of the Malleefowl offset area in order to be effective);


detail administrative matters including:

funding for implementation of the strategy;
performance indicators;
roles and responsibilities; and
monitoring and reporting standards; and


be accompanied by a shapefile defining the Malleefowl offset area.

Management measures must take into account the biodiversity values already present in the offset area, including in particular any species or communities listed as threatened under the EPBC Act.
Mining must not commence within the Mining Lease Area (MLA) until the strategy has been approved by the Minister.
Once approved, the strategy must be implemented.23/09/2011There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
