To ensure the long term viability of the offset and mitigation measures the approval holder must prepare and must submit for the Minister's approval an Offset Management Strategy (OMS) that provides for the ongoing protection of the following matters, which include BGW, Golden Sun Moth, Superb Parrot, Regent Honeyeater and the Swift Parrot. The OMS must include a process for the review of monitoring that has been undertaken so as to confirm the area and extent of impacts to the above matters resulting from the action. The approval holder must not commence the action unless and until the Minister has approved the OMS in writing. An Offset Management Plan (OMP) must be implemented that puts into action obligations of the OMS (refer to Condition 4 below).
The OMS must demonstrate potential offset sites, the likely form of land tenure arrangements and legal mechanisms that demonstrate that the offset sites can be created and managed to meet the requirements of the EPBC Offsets Policy and provide for the protection of BGW and habitat of threatened species on these sites for the duration of the action's impact through a legally binding conservation covenant which must be in force within 2 years of the commencement of the action.5/11/2014There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
