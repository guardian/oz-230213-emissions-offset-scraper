Within 3 months of the date of this approval the person taking the action must provide for the implementation of a suite of offset measures as set out in Stockland's letter to the Department of the Environment and Heritage of 18 December 2006 to mitigate against both the on- and offsite impacts of the development on the Black-throated Finch. The offset measures must satisfy the Minister and may include (but are not limited to):

research and studies into the Black-throated Finch, in particular its interaction with the urban environment;
research that results in increased understanding of the ecology of the species, including site fidelity and distribution;
improving the Black-throated Finch habitat quality on public land; and
future potential purchase or covenanting of suitable land for Black-throated Finch habitat.5/01/2007There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
