15. To offset the residual significant impact to the Greater Bilby, the person taking the action must ensure that the offsets program is undertaken by a suitably qualified ecologist, including:
a. a baseline survey to determine the area of occupancy of the Greater Bilby and its threats on the Dampier Peninsula must be developed and undertaken in conjunction with DPaW and Traditional Owner Rangers. The survey must use established techniques and record signs of Greater Bilby, signs of introduced predators, habitat characteristics, fire history and grazing pressure. This baseline survey must be undertaken on SLK 90-102.6 prior to commencement of the action. The baseline survey must be undertaken on SLK 25-90 prior construction occurring in SLK 25-90.
b. an annual and ongoing survey must be developed and implemented in conjunction with DPaW and Traditional Owner Rangers. This survey must commence within six months of completion of the baseline survey and continue for at least two years, and monitor:
i. at least four locations of the Greater Bilby population using DNA fingerprinting techniques
ii. the population of introduced predators through the use of camera traps
iii. grazing pressure, food resources and fire history.
c. a threat management program must be submitted to the Minister for approval prior to implementation. The threat management program must be developed and implemented in conjunction with DPaW and Traditional Owner Rangers and must address either introduced predators, fire regimes or grazing pressure or a combination of these threats at high priority sites for the Greater Bilby. The threat management program must include an adaptive management component. Threat management must commence within one year of commencement of the action and continue for at least one year. At least 120,000 is to be spent on direct threat abatement action per year of the threat management program
