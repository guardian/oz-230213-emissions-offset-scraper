No. . sort ascendingDetails. sort descendingStart Date. sort descending01For the protection of EPBC Act listed Black Cockatoos the approval holder must:

clear no more than 1.2 hectares (ha) of black cockatoo habitat within the project area (and no black cockatoo habitat outside the project area) and no more than one potential breeding tree;
install ten artificial nest hollows suitable for Black Cockatoos, which are to be additional to those required under any other approval, in accordance with the Western Australian Department of Parks and Wildlife Publication "How to design and place artificial hollows for Carnaby's cockatoo" (2015). The location of the artificial nest hollows must be determined by a suitably qualified person, and then agreed by DBCA prior to installation. The prime consideration in determining the location of the artificial nest hollows is to be maximising usage of the artifical hollows by Black Cockatoos. If after two years there is no evidence of use of the artificial nest hollows by Black Cockatoos then, in consultation with DBCA, they should be relocated to another suitable location;
comply with the conditions of clearing permit CPS 7943/1 or as varied from time to time; and
notify the Department in writing of any variations of the conditions of Clearing Permit CPS 7943/1 to which sub-condition 1(b) applies within 10 business days of such a change being approved by the State Government.5/12/2019There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
