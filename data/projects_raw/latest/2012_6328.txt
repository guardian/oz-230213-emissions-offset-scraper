The approved Wallum Sedge Frog Contingency and Offset Strategy must be implemented if the created habitat does not meet the success criteria specified in the Wallum Sedge Frog Management Plan. The Wallum Sedge Frog Contingency and Offset Strategy must include, but is not limited to, details of:

offset attributes of the areas proposed in Condition 13;
proposed arrangements for legal protection for the duration of the approval;
management actions to be undertaken and how they will be costed;
arrangements and responsibility for the ongoing management for the duration of the approval;
a methodology for provision of offsets consistent with the Environmental Offset Policy should the created habitat not meet the defined success criteria; and
