5. If a listed threatened species (or species habitat) or community (other than small-flower grevillea, green and golden bell frog or giant barred frog) is encountered during a pre-clearance survey (or at any other time), prior to any further clearance of native vegetation which has been identified as supporting a listed threatened species (or species habitat) or community, the person taking the action must provide the minister with the survey report prepared under Condition 4. The minister may direct the person taking the action to prepare a management plan for the listed threatened species (or species habitat) or community. The plan must be prepared by a suitably qualified person with prior written approval of the department and must include:

discussion of distribution and current legal status;
discussion of key ecological features of the species or community;
discussion of the biology and reproductive needs of the species (if a species);
discussion and working definition(s) of "habitat" (if a species), considering:

habitat function (for example distinguishing where relevant between breeding habitat and foraging habitat); and
habitat quality (with reference to both key features and landscape context);


results of targeted surveys, including quantification of occurrence or habitat extent and a map of the location of the species or community occurrence on the site of the action (or its area of influence);
description of measures that will be employed to avoid or mitigate impacts on the species or community;
quantification of any unavoidable impact (expressed as an area in hectares in the case of a community or fauna habitat or number of individuals); and
a detailed description of measures to offset that impact (including in relation to direct offsets, size, location, ecological attributes and mechanisms for legal ensuring enduring protection).

 Clearance of native vegetation which has been identified as supporting a listed threatened species (or species habitat) or community may only recommence on the written authorisation of the minister or the approval by the minister of a species management plan.
Each approved species management plan must be published by the person taking the action on their website, for the duration of this approval, within twenty (20) business days of its approval by the minister, and must be implemented.11/02/2013There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
