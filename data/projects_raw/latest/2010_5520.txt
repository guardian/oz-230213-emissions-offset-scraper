To offset impacts on the Golden Sun Moth (Synemon plana) the person taking the action must, in agreement with the ACT Government, develop a plan to protect and manage the offset area to the north-east of the Macgregor West 2 Estate (as defined at Appendix 1), for Golden Sun Moth (GSM) habitat. The plan must include measures:

to provide a final map of the Macgregor West 2 Estate and offset area that defines:

the grassland rehabilitation project area (as required by conditions 2(g) and 2(h)),
where fencing will be located, and
the final position of stormwater control ponds;


for the person taking the action to fence the offset area, including provision of information on the:

type of fencing, and
timing for implementation of the fencing;


to manage the offset area within the ACT nature reserve system in perpetuity;
to mitigate indirect impacts of residential development on GSM habitat within the offset area and buffer zone (required by condition 3), including but not limited to stormwater runoff, weeds and public access;
to manage the impacts of stock grazing on GSM habitat;
to manage the impacts of fire on GSM habitat;
to address rehabilitation of Chilean Needle Grass habitat with predominantly native grasses, whilst aiming to ensure the long-term survival of GSM within the offset area at Macgregor West;
to contribute at least $200,000.00 towards the implementation of university-based research into rehabilitation of Chilean Needle Grass with native grasses;
to monitor, review, report and respond to the results of the grassland rehabilitation project (as required by conditions 2(g) and 2(h));
to provide for public participation in development of the management plan; and
to provide interpretative signage about the GSM, its habitat and grassland rehabilitation project at the Macgregor West offset area.

In the event that an acceptable plan is not submitted to the Minister within 6 months after the commencement of the action, the Minister may instruct that all activities within the project area must cease immediately until the Minister has approved the plan. The approved plan must be implemented.8/09/2010There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
