By no later than 31 July 2020, the person taking the action must register the Biodiversity Management Areas identified in the map at Attachment A under a legally secured offset mechanism.

The OMP must include, but not be limited to, the following information:

a textual description and map to clearly define the location and boundaries of all of the Biodiversity Management Areas. This must be accompanied with the offset attributes and a shapefile
details of management actions to protect and enhance the extent and condition of habitat values of the offset areas including but not limited to rehabilitation, weed control, fire management, erosion and sediment control, management of livestock and restrictions on access of no less than 1,586 hectares of habitat for the regent honeyeater and swift parrot

a process to report, to the department, the management actions undertaken in the offset areas and the outcome of those actions, including identifying any need for improved management
a description of the potential risks to successful management and rehabilitation in the offset areas, and a description of the contingency measures that would be implemented to mitigate these risks
