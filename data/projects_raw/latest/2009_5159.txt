The person taking the action must, within 12 months of the date of this approval, ensure that a perpetual conservation covenant for the offsets referred to in Figure1 is drawn up and lodged with the Crown for execution and registration on the title documents of the land. The Department must be provided with a copy of the signed conservation covenant within 2 weeks of its signature by all parties.7/01/2010033.

The Nature Conservation Plan must be provided to the Minister for approval within 12 months of the date of this approval. The approved Nature Conservation Plan must be implemented for a period of at least 10 years from its approval. The Nature Conservation Plan must provide for the conservation and enhancement of the Swift Parrot habitat on the protected land, and:

include specific measures to:

control weed species and pest animals;
control access to the protected land;
monitor on an annual basis the presence or absence of Swift Parrots and condition of Swift Parrot habitat, and note any nesting or breeding activity observed;
report the results of monitoring and management activities to the Department; and
identify other EPBC Act listed threatened species and ecological communities that occur within the proposed offset areas.


include measures to ensure that actions taken to conserve, and enhance Swift Parrot habitat have no detrimental impact on the habitat and populations of other EPBC Act listed threatened species and ecological communities that are identified in the Nature Conservation Plan as occurring on the protected land.
include corrective actions and contingency measures to be implemented where monitoring of the offsets under the Nature Conservation Plan indicates a degradation of Swift Parrot habitat.7/01/2010There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
