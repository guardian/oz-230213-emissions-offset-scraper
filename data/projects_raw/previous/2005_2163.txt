For the better protection of the Calyptorphynchus latirostris (Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo) and Calyptorhynchus baudinii (Baudin's Black-Cockatoo), the person taking the action must prepare a conservation, offsets, and rehabilitation plan (the plan) to achieve the following outcomes in order of priority:

Preservation of at least 75 ha of existing remnant vegetation which contains foraging and/or breeding habitat for the above species in a secure tenure such as a conservation covenant (as identified in red, in Attachment A);
Improvement in quality of existing remnant habitat areas on site through rehabilitation and weed management strategies;
Expansion of breeding and foraging habitat offsite;
Rehabilitation of foraging habitat areas on the mining area (Attachment A).

The plan must ensure there is a net gain in the extent and quality of breeding and foraging habitat for the Calyptorphynchus latirostris (Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo) and Calyptorhynchus baudinii (Baudin's Black-Cockatoo).
The plan must include:

criteria for determining the success of plan;
parameters to be monitored and frequency of monitoring;
an assessment of the risks to achieving the success criteria;
measures that will be used to manage risks, including contingency measures;
reporting arrangements to management, external stakeholders and the public.

The plan must be submitted to the Minister for approval. The plan should be submitted sufficiently in advance of commencement of the action to allow for (if necessary) changes, and approval by the Minister. The action cannot commence until the plan is approved by the Minister. The approved plan must be implemented.16/02/2010There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
