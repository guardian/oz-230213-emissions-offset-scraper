23. The person taking the action must submit an Offset Strategy (or Strategies1) to the Minister for approval within twelve months of the date of the commencement of the action. The person taking the action must not transport gas through the pipeline until the Offset Strategy (or Strategies) has been approved in writing by the Minister. The approved Offset Strategy (or Strategies) must be implemented. The Offset Strategy or Strategies must:

Be consistent with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, Environmental Offsets Policy, October 2012 (Offsets Policy) and include explanations as to how the offsets meet the principles of this Offsets Policy and the relevant fields of the associated Offsets Assessment Guide
Include an offset for the residual significant impacts to 150 ha of Gouldian Finch breeding habitat. The offset must include threat abatement in the form of fire management and feral pig control, be at least 3600 ha of Gouldian Finch breeding and foraging habitat in size and be managed for at least 20 years.
Include an offset for any residual significant impacts to the Red Goshawk, Northern Masked Owl, Northern Crested Shrike-tit, Northern Quoll and Bare-rumped Sheathtail Bat as a result of any uncertainty in the effectiveness of the Pre-clearance Strategy in identifying important habitat features and the residual impacts identified in Condition 12b. The offset strategy should consider the use of fire management, cat control and weed management threat abatement measures.
Include an offset for any residual significant impacts to the Gulf Snapping Turtle or Freshwater Sawfish as a result of the residual impacts from not undertaking Horizontal Directional Drilling identified in Condition 20(b)iii.

1 It is acceptable to submit multiple Offset Strategies so as to facilitate timely implementation of offsets, noting that the offsets required at 23c and 23d will need to be determined post-construction.29/11/2013There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
