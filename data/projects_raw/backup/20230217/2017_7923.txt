To compensate for the loss of any suitable nesting hollow/s within the project area, the approval holder must install within the Parks and Recreation reserve, in accordance with the artificial hollow installation guidelines, at least 3 artificial nesting hollows for every suitable nesting hollow that will be cleared. To maximise the likelihood of the installed artificial nesting hollows being used by Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo, the approval holder must:a. install the artificial nesting hollows at least three (3) months prior to the commencement of clearing suitable nesting hollow/s;b. provide the department and the DBCA with written evidence of the installation of the artificial nest hollows at least twenty (20) business days prior to commencement of clearing any suitable nesting hollow/s;c. undertake adaptive management of the artificial nesting hollows and, as a component of adaptive management, ensure that each installed artificial hollow is:i. monitored and maintained in accordance with the artificial hollow maintenance guidelines for the life of the approval, or an earlier date agreed to by the department in writing, with maintenance actions undertaken outside of the breeding season; andii. not installed in a manner that requires additional clearing of Carnaby’s Black Cockatoos breeding habitat or Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo foraging habitat, or within ten (10) metres of any edge of road seals or buildings, to reduce the risk of vehicle strike and human disturbance.
d. ensure that each installed artificial nesting hollow is inspected at least twice each year, and at least four (4) weeks apart, by a suitably qualified ecologist during the peak breeding season for the life of the approval, or an earlier date agreed to by the department in writing, commencing within one (1) year of their installation, to record evidence of use by Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo and to identify any maintenance requirements. The findings of this monitoring program must be provided to the department in each compliance report.e. If after four (4) years, the monitoring reports confirm that no Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo are breeding in the Parks and Recreation reserve, the approval holder must, relocate all artificial nest hollows that are not being utilised to alternative locations within the breeding range of the species where there is evidence that breeding has been successful but where hollow numbers are limiting for Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo breeding.15/09/2021There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
