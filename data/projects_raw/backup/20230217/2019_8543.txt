identify a suitable environmental offset(s) for the impacts on listed threatened species and listed ecological communitiesinclude summary information on the impacted areas and detailed baseline information on the proposed offset(s) and commit to achievable ecological benefits, and timeframes for their achievement, for the proposed offset(s)for Black Cockatoos, this must include the total number suitable nest hollows identified during the pre-clearance survey specified in condition 7 and the number of suitable nest hollows and trees with a diameter at breast height of greater than 500 mm cleared.describe the monitoring program(s) to be implemented that will determine progress towards, attainment of and maintenance of the ecological benefits for the Black Cockatoos, Western Ringtail Possum, Banksia Woodland TEC and Tuart Woodlands and Forests TEC at the proposed offset(s)specify how and at what frequency offset(s) management results, monitoring program findings and assessments of ecological benefits will be reported to the Department and the publicdetail how the offset(s) will be protected, and ecological benefits maintained, in perpetuity.16If the Offset Strategy has not been submitted for approval by the Minister within 6 months of commencement of the action, all clearing and/or construction must cease immediately.

for Black Cockatoos, this must include the total number suitable nest hollows identified during the pre-clearance survey specified in condition 7 and the number of suitable nest hollows and trees with a diameter at breast height of greater than 500 mm actually cleared.
the relevant protected matters and a reference to the EPBC Act approval conditions to which the particular Offset Management Plan refersmanagement actions, and the timing of those actions, that will be implemented to achieve the ecological benefits for relevant protected mattersfor Black cockatoos, this must include details of the design, location and methods of installation and maintenance for 10 years following installation, of artificial hollows totalling at least 3 times the number of suitable nest hollows cleared under condition 1(a)(ii.).a table of commitments made in the Offset Management Plan to achieve the ecological benefits for relevant protected matters, and a reference to where the commitments are detailed in the Offset Management Planreporting and review mechanisms, and documentation standards that will be implemented to inform others annually regarding compliance with management and environmental commitments, and attainment and maintenance of the ecological benefits as specified in the Offset Management Planan assessment of risks to achieving the ecological benefits and what risk management strategies will be applied to address thesea monitoring program, which must include:evaluating evidence that effectively determine progress towards, attainment of and maintenance of the ecological benefits for the protected matters measurable performance indicators to monitor attainment of the ecological benefits for the protected matterstrigger values for corrective actionsthe timing and frequency of monitoring to detect trigger values and changes in the performance indicators.proposed corrective actions to ensure ecological benefits for the protected matters are attained or maintained if trigger values are reached or performance indicators not attainedlinks to referenced plans and applicable conditions of approval (including State approval conditions) if any.19The approval holder must implement each approved Offset Management Plan for the life of the approval.
