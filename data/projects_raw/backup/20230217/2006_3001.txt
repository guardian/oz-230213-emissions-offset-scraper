To protect the threatened species listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), in particular the Growling Grass Frog (Litoria raniformis), the person taking the action must implement the recommendations outlined in the Growling Grass Frog Conservation Management Plan September 2008 (GGFCMP). In particular the following actions must be undertaken:

At least 39.4ha of Growling Grass Frog habitat and associated open space must be created and / or retained, including breeding, foraging and connectivity habitat. Growling Grass Frog habitat must be designed by a suitably qualified person;
At least seven specifically designed Growling Grass Frog wetlands must be created. These wetlands must vary in shape and size and each wetland must be a minimum 20m long by 5m wide;
The two existing Growling Grass Frog breeding habitats (D and E identified in Figure 1) must not be removed until successful breeding can be proven in the created wetlands. Successful breeding is defined by the presence of Growling Grass Frog metamorphs at at least two constructed wetlands within the action area for at least three non-consecutive years. The person taking the action must provide this evidence to the Department and approval must be obtained from the Department prior to the removal of this habitat;
Existing dams must be removed in a staged manner to ensure suitable Growling Grass Frog habitat is always available; and
Monitoring for the presence of predatory fish species, including the Mosquito Fish (Gambusia holbrooki) in dedicated Growling Grass Frog wetlands must be undertaken on a six-monthly basis. If predatory fish species are present the wetlands must be drained during the Growling Grass Frog non-breeding season (March-August) and must be refilled prior to the onset of the Growling Grass Frog breeding season (October).14/10/2008There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
