specify investigation and response procedures in the event that baseline surface water offsets required in this condition are unlikely to be met;
response procedures to be followed if any impacts on surface or groundwater are detected during the project;
specify notification procedures to the department in the event that impacts on surface or groundwater are detected during the project.27/09/2011There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
