To offset the residual significant impact to the Sandhill Dunnart (Sminthopsis psammophila), the person taking the action must prepare a Sandhill Dunnart Conservation Plan (the Plan) to reduce the threat to the Sandhill Dunnart posed by feral animals within the defined area.
The Plan must be prepared by a suitably qualified expert and in consultation with the WA Department of Parks and Wildlife. The Plan must:
a) define the area over which the Plan applies (the defined area). The defined area must:
i. be located outside of the MRUP development envelope, but within the project boundary
ii. contain at least 6000 ha of suitable habitat for the Sandhill Dunnart
iii. contain a local population of Sandhill Dunnart.
b) detail objectives and measurable performance indicators for implementing the Plan and managing threats to the Sandhill Dunnart within the defined area relating to feral animals
c) detail the methodology that will be implemented for determining the baseline condition of the defined area including estimated baseline local population of Sandhill Dunnart and feral animals
d) detail management actions that will be implemented to achieve the objectives of the Plan
e) identify and manage risks associated with achieving the Plan’s objectives
f) detail contingency responses and corrective actions that will be implemented should performance indicators not be achieved. This includes trigger values for implementing contingency responses and corrective actions, and the timeframes in which corrective actions will be implemented
g) detail a monitoring program, including a monitoring methodology, to review effectiveness of management actions and to support an adaptive management approach to implementation of the Plan
h) provide the timing and frequency of management actions, monitoring and reporting programs and the person/s responsible for implementing the actions and programs2/03/2017There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
