Mitigation measures to manage the impact of port operation and shipping, arising from Port Spencer construction and operation activities, including underwater noise caused by the port and vessels and the risk of vessel strike;
Consideration and management of cumulative impacts arising from Port Spencer construction and operation activities; and
Management of noise impacts is to be included in the management plan and underwater noise must not exceed 183 dB re 1µ Pa2.s.
