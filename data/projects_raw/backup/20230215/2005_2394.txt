To minimise the impacts on Carnabys Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) the person taking the action must implement measures to assist in the long term protection of the species. The measures must include (but not be limited to):

reservation of no less than 1.82 hectares of Banksia woodland as Public Open Space in the centre of the development as identified in the site plan at Schedule 1. Clearing of vegetation in the public open space will not be permitted;
development and implementation of a management plan for banksia vegetation on site which conserves habitat for the Carnabys Black Cockatoo in perpetuity;
conservation of greater than 40 percent of the Tuart trees on the school site in the south-eastern portion of the lot and retention or establishment of Tuart trees on the road reserves;
erection of signs to inform the community about the environmental value and significance of the Carnabys Black Cockatoo population and the role played by vegetation habitat isolates and corridors. Information on the signs must be clearly visible and legible from a distance of 5 metres.
inclusion of information in the prospectus for the residential lots which explains the significance of the site to Carnabys Black Cockatoo and outlines appropriate actions residents can take, such as planting native species in their gardens and reducing attacks from domestic animals;
construction of no less than 10 artificial Black-Cockatoo hollows within the trees to be retained within the Public Open Space and within the school site; and
rehabilitation of Public Open Space areas only with local plant species that are quick growing and that produce seeds favoured by Carnabys Black Cockatoos and agreed by Birds Australia WA.29/08/2007There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
