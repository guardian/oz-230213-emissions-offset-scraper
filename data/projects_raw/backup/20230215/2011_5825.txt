To protect habitat for Black Cockatoos, the person taking the action must:

not clear more than 10 ha of foraging and/or potential breeding habitat for Black Cockatoos within 3 years of the commencement of the action, and not clear more than a total 38.5 ha of such habitat;
within 12 months of the commencement of the action, install at least 15 plastic nesting boxes for Black Cockatoos. The nesting hollows must be located near known or likely Black Cockatoo breeding habitat, either in a conservation area managed by the DPAW or another area which has been approved in writing by the Department and the approval holder must ensure that these are maintained in a condition suitable for use by Black Cockatoos for the life of the approval.

In order to offset the impact of clearing of Black Cockatoo habitat, the person taking the action must:
c.  Provide funds to the DPAW sufficient to acquire either:


an offset package that must include:





a property with at least 60 ha of Black Cockatoo foraging habitat located within 50 km of the project site (and provide the funds for the acquisition of this property within 12 months of the commencement of the action); and
a property with at least 300 ha of Black Cockatoo foraging habitat (and provide the funds for the acquisition of this property within 3 years of the commencement of the action); or





an alternative offset package that has been approved in writing by the Department (and provide funds for this within a period that has been approved in writing by the Department, but in any case no longer than two years after the commencement of the action).


d.   For each component of condition 10 (c), within the same timeframes for which funds must be provided to the DPAW under condition 10 (c), provide to the Department:


documentary evidence that funds have been provided to the DPAW to acquire each offset component; and
a textual description and map (accompanied with the offset attributes and a shapefile) to clearly define the location and boundaries of each offset component.15/03/2019There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
