3. To compensate for residual impacts to box gum woodland, the approval holder must formally incorporate the offset site into the Pinnacle Nature Reserve for conservation purposes (as further described at condition four (4)). Evidence of the formal transition must be provided to the Department within two (2) years of the date of this approval.17/10/2014044.  For the enduring conservation, management and monitoring of the offset site, the approval holder must engage a suitably qualified person to develop an Offset Management Plan (OMP). The OMP must be submitted to the Minister for approval within twelve (12) months of the date of this approval. The OMP must include details on:


location of the offset site including clear maps and accompanying shapefiles


baseline surveys to confirm the extent and quality of box gum woodland onsite


management of:


soil erosion


pests, feral animals and grazing stock


weeds and pathogens (in particular, measures to avoid the seed setting and dispersal of key weed species)


fire (to maintain the ecological integrity of ecosystems)


unwanted access (including the use of fencing and signage)

assisted regeneration and revegetation                                                                       This must include details on timing and duration. Priority areas for rehabilitation (both short and long term) must also be clearly illustrated using maps



objectives and performance indicators associated with all items listed at (c) making reference to claimed offset scores and corresponding contingency or remedial measures. These must be framed in the context of restoring structure and ecological function to box gum woodland consistent with Departmental policy statements.


monitoring and reporting measures associated with all items listed at (c). Monitoring must be able to quantify a change in the quality of box gum woodland onsite, in response to management actions


scheduling and costing estimates associated with all management actions


provisions for the transition of the offset site to the Pinnacle Nature Reserve, including a statement of commitment by the relevant government agency to ongoing maintenance, enduring management, and associated annual resourcing


The OMP must demonstrate how management of the offset site is complimentary (and additional) to restoration activities previously carried out on site. The approved OMP must be implemented. Until such time as the Minister has approved the OMP, the interim offset management plan must be implemented.17/10/2014There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
