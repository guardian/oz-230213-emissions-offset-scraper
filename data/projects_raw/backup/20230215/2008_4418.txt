The approval holder must provide an offset area of 51 hectares of Brigalow dominated vegetation which must be protected under a Nature Refuge Agreement under the Nature Conservation Act 1994 (Queensland) to offset the loss of 10.2ha of endangered Brigalow ecological community.
Evidence of the establishment of the Nature Refuge must be provided to the Department by 30 April 2010.8/09/2015033. To offset impacts to Brigalow ecological community and the Squatter Pigeon, the approval holder must achieve the following outcomes (relative to baseline monitoring as discussed in condition 4):

Over time, there must be no net loss to the extent and condition of Brigalow ecological community within the offset area required under condition 1.
Over time, there must be no net loss to the extent and condition of Squatter Pigeon habitat within the offset area required under condition 2a.8/09/2015044. The approval holder must undertake a monitoring program (which includes baseline monitoring) at the offset areas required under conditions 1 and 2a and at control sites. The results of the monitoring program must be adequate to inform adaptive management and demonstrate whether the outcomes described in condition 3 are being met. Monitoring must be undertaken by a suitably qualified person and must take into consideration the BioCondition Assessment Manual. Performance indicators which must be monitored include:

for Brigalow ecological community: ecosystem functionality and condition; and cover of plant species that are known to make up the ecological community as defined in the Approved Conservation Advice for Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla dominant and co-dominant); and
for Squatter Pigeon habitat: ecosystem functionality and condition; and the presence of exotic herbivores and predators.8/09/2015There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
