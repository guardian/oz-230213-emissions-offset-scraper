10) For the protection of the Koala (and Koala habitat) and the Grey-headed Flying-fox (and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat), by the end of year 1 the approval holder must increase the visibility to fauna of perimeter barbed-wire fencing (if used), including by affixing durable visibility tags at every 30 cm interval along the top strand of any perimeter barbed-wire fencing.19/02/20211111) The approval holder must achieve the following outcomes in the Woolooga Offset Site (intact):

b) By the end of year 5, the number of large trees greater than 100% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present and subsequently maintain or exceed this outcome for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval;
c) Tree canopy height greater than 70% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present and subsequently maintain or exceed this outcome for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval;
d) An average tree canopy cover maintained at between greater than 50% and less than 200% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems and subsequently maintain or exceed this outcome for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval;
e) An increase, relative to the baseline habitat quality assessment data, in Koala usage by the end of year 5, and subsequently maintain or exceed this outcome for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval; and
f) An average of at least 5 different Grey-Headed Flying-fox winter or spring flowering foraging species present per hectare by the end of year 5, and subsequently maintain or exceed this outcome for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval.19/02/202112Habitat Creation
12) The approval holder must achieve the following outcomes in the Woolooga Offset Site (regen):
a) Recreate the relevant pre-clearing Regional Ecosystem, as identified in the baseline survey, required under condition 6;
b) Complete all planting of 86.7 ha of new Koala Habitat and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat by the end of year 1;
c) Average recruitment of woody perennial species in the ecologically dominant layer greater than 20% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present, by the end of year 5;
d) Average recruitment of woody perennial species in the ecologically dominant layer at greater than 75% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present, by the end of year 10, and subsequently maintain or exceed that rate of recruitment for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval;
e) The number of large trees at least 25% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present, by the end of year 10;
f) The number of large trees at least 50% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present, by the end of year 20 and this proportion subsequently maintained or exceeded for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval;
g) Average tree canopy cover greater than 10% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present, by the end of year 10, and subsequently maintain or exceed 10% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval;
h) Average tree canopy height greater than 25% of the benchmark for relevant Regional Ecosystems present at the site, by the end of year 10, and subsequently maintain or exceed that tree canopy height for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval;
i) An increase, relative to the baseline habitat quality assessment data, in Koala usage by the end of year 5, and subsequently maintain or exceed this outcome for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval; and
j) An average of at least 5 different Grey-headed Flying-fox winter or spring flowering foraging species present in each assessment plot by the end of year 10, and subsequently maintain or exceed this diversity of foraging species for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval.19/02/20211313) The approval holder must engage a suitably qualified field ecologist to undertake an assessment, at the end of each of year 5, year 10, year 15, and year 20, as to whether each outcome required under conditions 7-12 has been, or is likely to be, achieved in accordance with the condition requirements, and provide advice of any circumstance/s which they consider is/are affecting the achievement of each outcome. The findings of each assessment must be documented and published on the website within 3 months of the end of the particular period of which the assessment is undertaken and be provided to the Department within 5 business days of being published.19/02/20211414) If, at any time during the period of effect of the approval, the Minister is not satisfied that any of the requirements and/or outcomes under the conditions of approval, including (but not limited to) conditions 7-12, have been or are likely to be achieved or maintained, the Minister may require the approval holder to submit a corrective action plan for the Woolooga Offset Site for the Minister’s approval, or to monitor, manage, avoid, mitigate, offset, record and/or report on, impacts to the Koala and/or the Grey-headed Flying-fox.
a) The Minister may set a timeframe in which the corrective action plan must be submitted and suitable for approval, may require that the corrective action plan be prepared and/or reviewed by a suitably qualified independent expert and may specify consequences for the approval holder if the corrective action plan is not suitable for approval within the specified timeframe.
b) The approval holder must implement the corrective action plan approved by the Minister in writing.19/02/20214Environmental Offset Requirements
4) To compensate for the clearing of up to 176 ha of Koala habitat and 83.38 ha of Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat, the approval holder must:
a) Commence management activities at the Woolooga Offset Site prior to undertaking any clearing at the development area;
b) Legally secure at least 196.42 ha of land at the Woolooga Offset Site by the end of year 1; and
c) Within 20 business days of legally securing at least at least 196.42 ha of land at the Woolooga Offset Site, provide the Department with written evidence demonstrating that the Woolooga Offset Site has been legally secured (e.g. legal security documentation), and shapefiles of the offset attributes.
Note: Uses or activities at the Woolooga offset site are not permitted if they are not compatible with the primary purpose of conservation.19/02/20215Baseline survey information
5) By the end of year 1, the approval holder must complete baseline surveys of the entire Woolooga Offset Site. The baseline surveys must be conducted by a suitably qualified field ecologist in accordance with a scientifically valid, robust, and repeatable methodology, and include the following:
a) Detailed baseline habitat quality assessment data for each Environmental Management Zone;
b) The vegetation condition attributes for each Regional Ecosystem present;
c) The number and condition of Grey-headed Flying-fox winter or spring flowering foraging species present;
d) The Species Stocking Rate;
e) The extent of weed cover;
f) The number of non-native predators and non-native herbivores across, and where possible surrounding, the Woolooga Offset Site;
g) The number of Koala mortalities attributable to non-native predators; and
h) The baseline conditions in respect of each of the outcomes specified in conditions 7-12.19/02/202166) Within three (3) months after the end of year 1, the approval holder must publish on its website a report containing all survey data (including survey methodology and dates) from the baseline surveys required under condition 6 including a program to monitor and report on progress against the ecological outcomes specified in conditions 7-12. A copy of this information and evidence of the date of publication on the website must be provided to the Department within 3 months after the end of year 1.19/02/20217Pest and weed management
7) The approval holder must achieve a 90% or greater reduction in the number of non-native predators and non-native herbivores by the end of year 5, relative to the numbers identified during the baseline surveys conducted in year 1, and ensure that the number of non-native predators and non-native herbivores are then maintained at, or reduced below, the year 5 numbers for the remaining period of effect of this approval.19/02/202188) The approval holder must ensure the extent of weed cover across the whole Woolooga Offset Site is:
a) Less than 20% by the end of year 5; and
b) Less than 5% by the end of year 10, and then maintained at 5% or less for the remaining period of effect of this approval.19/02/2021There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
