Note: the proposed offset package including habitat construction is expected to provide approximately five times the offset required to appropriately compensate for the impact in accordance with the EPBC Act environmental offsets policy. Therefore this approval should not prevent the approval holder requesting the Minister consider up to 80% of the value of the offset delivered as part of the action as an advanced offset for a future impact on the Green and Golden Bell Frog. This note is not a guarantee that any advanced offset proposal associated with this action will be accepted by the Minister for any project with a future significant impact on the Green and Golden Bell Frog.20/07/2018There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
