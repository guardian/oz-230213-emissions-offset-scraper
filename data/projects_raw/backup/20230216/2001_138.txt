No. . sort ascendingDetails. sort descendingStart Date. sort descending022. Prior to commencement of construction, the person taking the action must prepare and submit for the Minister's approval, an Environmental Offset Strategy to manage the impacts of the action on the values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. The Environmental Offset Strategy must address the matters listed below and state the environmental objectives, performance criteria, monitoring, reporting, funding, responsibility and timing of each of these matters.
The Environmental Offset Strategy must be designed to achieve an annual net-reduction to nutrient and sediment loads entering the Great Barrier Reef from the commencement of construction and must:

Identify offsets which will achieve an annual net-reduction in nutrients and suspended solids entering the Great Barrier Reef;
Provide evidence that the funding and measures outlined in condition 2(a) are independent and in addition to the Australian Government’s Reef Rescue Plan;
Provide the results of detailed modelling to demonstrate that the measures identified in condition 2(a) will result in a net-reduction in nutrient and sediment discharge into the Great Barrier Reef. This must include baseline studies to determine existing background levels of nutrients and solids being discharged into Abbot Bay. The model must be suitable for the range of expected hydrological events and flow conditions and be valid for the region and climate the offset is identified in. The Environmental Management Plan must also include a discussion of the results of the model, including calibration, and assessment of the validity of the model; and
The results of the modelling required at condition 2(c) must be independently reviewed by a suitably qualified independent expert to demonstrate the validity of the modelling and results.

Operation of the Guthalungra Aquaculture Facility cannot commence until the Environmental Offset Strategy is submitted and approved by the Minister. Once approved, the Environmental Offset Strategy must be implemented prior to the date of commencement of operation for the operational life of the Guthalungra Aquaculture Facility25/09/2018There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
