No. . sort ascendingDetails. sort descendingStart Date. sort descending10If required under condition 9, the SOAMP must detail the additional and revised management measures and/or offset site(s) that will be implemented and offset site(s) secured to compensate, to the satisfaction of the Minister, for the non-achievement of offset completion criteria specified in the approved OAMP.22/02/202211The approval holder must secure any offset site(s) specified in the approved SOAMP within 12 months of the date that the SOAMP is approved in writing by the Minister. The approved SOAMP must be attached to the legal mechanism used to secure the offset site(s) specified in the approved SOAMP.22/02/202212The approval holder must notify the department within 5 business days of the mechanism to secure each offset site having been executed.22/02/20223To compensate for the total clearance of habitat for EPBC Act listed threatened species not including Macrozamia conferta habitat up to the limits as specified in condition 1, the approval holder must provide an environmental offset in accordance with the principles of the Environmental Offsets Policy to the satisfaction of the Minister.22/02/20224The approval holder must implement the Interim Offset Area Management Plan (IOAMP) upon the commencement of the action and until the Minister has approved an Offset Area Management Plan (OAMP).22/02/20225The approval holder must submit an OAMP prepared by a suitably qualified ecologist to the department three months after the commencement of the action for the written approval of the Minister. The approval holder must not commission until the OAMP has been approved in writing by the Minister. The approval holder must implement the approved OAMP.22/02/20226
The OAMP must include:

a summary of the residual impacts to protected matters that will be compensated for by the offset. This summary must include the area(s) of habitat for protected matters and its condition and quality at all impact sites which the particular offset is to address;
a table of commitments made in the OAMP to achieve the ecological benefits for relevant protected matters, and a reference to where the commitments are detailed in the OAMP;
a description of the offset site(s), including location, size, condition, environmental values present and surrounding land uses;
baseline data, including results from field validation surveys, and quantifiable ecological data on site habitat quality, and other supporting evidence, that documents:

that suitable habitat for each EPBC Act listed threatened species will be present within the offset site(s);
the quality and condition of habitat for each EPBC Act listed threatened species within the offset site(s);
the presence of Koala individuals within the offset site(s);
the presence of Greater Glider within the offset site(s) or within the home-range of Greater Glider in adjacent, connected Greater Glider habitat; and
the nature and extent of any weeds and feral animals at the offset site(s).


an assessment of site habitat quality for each habitat feature;
details of how the offset site(s) will provide connectivity with habitat features outside the offset site/s and biodiversity corridors for each EPBC Act listed threatened species;
maps and shapefiles that clearly define the location and boundaries of the offset site(s), accompanied by offset attribute;
specific offset completion criteria derived from the site habitat quality scores to demonstrate the improvement in the quality of habitat for each EPBC Act listed threatened species within the offset site(s) over the period of effect of this approval to the satisfaction of the Minister;
details of the management actions, and timeframes for implementation, to be undertaken to achieve the offset completion criteria, including but not limited to;

control of grazing stock within the offset site(s);
control of grazing within riparian zones of the offset site(s);
establishment of the typical range of tree species native to the Nandewar Bioregion, in particular local Eucalyptus species;
measures to protect juvenile trees from grazing by native and invasive species;
weed and feral animal management; and
a commitment to maintain or improve the key habitat features within the offset sites(s) for the duration of the approval.


interim milestones that set targets at 5-yearly intervals for progress towards achieving the offset completion criteria;
details of the nature, timing and frequency of monitoring to report progress against achieving the 5-yearly interim milestones and maintaining improvements of site habitat quality. The frequency of monitoring must be sufficient to track progress towards each set of milestones, and sufficient to determine whether the environmental offset is likely to achieve those milestones in adequate time to implement all necessary corrective actions;
timing for the submission of interim monitoring reports which provide evidence demonstrating whether the interim milestones and offset completion criteria are likely to be achieved and subsequently have been achieved;
timing for the implementation of corrective actions if monitoring activities indicate the interim milestones are unlikely to be, or have not been, achieved;
a risk analysis and a risk management and mitigation strategy for all risks to the successful implementation of the OAMP and timely achievement of the offset completion criteria, including a rating of all initial and post-mitigation residual risks in accordance with the risk assessment matrix;
evidence of how the management actions and corrective actions take into account relevant approved conservation advices and are consistent with relevant recovery plans and threat abatement plans and where applicable, other relevant documents; and
details of the legal mechanism for securing the environmental offset, such that legal security remains in force over the offset site(s) for at least the period of effect of this approval.


22/02/20227The approval holder must secure the offset site(s) specified in the approved OAMP within 12 months of the date that the OAMP is approved in writing by the Minister. The approved OAMP must be attached to the legal mechanism used to secure the environmental offset.22/02/20228The offset completion criteria as specified in the approved OAMP must be achieved within 20 years of the commencement of the actionand then be maintained or exceeded for the duration of the approval. The approval holder must regularly analyse the results of monitoring so as to be able to anticipate any likely failure to achieve the interim milestones and completion criteria and, so as to avoid such failure, promptly propose improved or additional management measures and/or offset site(s) in one or more revised versions of the OAMP and seek Minister approval of any such revised OAMP.22/02/20229If the offset completion criteria specified in the approved OAMP are not met within 20 years of the commencement of the action, the approval holder must, within 10 business days of the 20thanniversary of the commencement of the action:

notify the department which offset completion criteria have not been met, by how much, and the likely cause(s) of the completion criteria not being met;
submit to the department within 4 months of the 20th anniversary of the commencement of the action a Supplementary Offset Area Management Plan (SOAMP) for the approval of the Minister.22/02/2022There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
