126 ha of Brigalow ecological community; and
733.3 ha of Bluegrass ecological community.15/01/20161313. To offset impacts to Brigalow ecological community and Bluegrass ecological community, the approval holder must achieve the following outcomes (relative to baseline monitoring as discussed in condition 14):

Over time, there must be no net loss to the extent and condition of Brigalow ecological community within the offset area required under condition 2a; and
Over time, there must be no net loss to the extent and condition of Bluegrass ecological community within the offset area required under condition 2b.15/01/20161414. The approval holder must undertake a monitoring program (which includes baseline monitoring) at the offset areas required under conditions 2a and 2b and at control sites. The results of the monitoring program must be adequate to inform adaptive management and demonstrate whether the outcomes described in condition 13 are being met. Monitoring must be undertaken by a suitably qualified person and must take into consideration the BioCondition Assessment Manual. Performance indicators which must be monitored include:

for Brigalow ecological community: ecosystem functionality and condition; and cover of plant species that are known to make up the ecological community as defined in the Approved Conservation Advice for Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla dominant and co-dominant); and
for Bluegrass ecological community: ecosystem functionality and condition; including presence of perennial grass indicator species, tussock cover, woody shrub cover and introduced species cover as described in Table 1 of the Commonwealth Listing Advice on Natural Grasslands of the Queensland Central Highlands and the northern Fitzroy Basin.15/01/2016There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
