To protect the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) listed flora and fauna species (for those species that are listed as at the approval decision date) that are known to or could potentially occur in the action area, the person taking the action must develop an EPBC Act Listed Flora and Fauna Management Strategy. This strategy must include:
  
  Identification of areas of the action area within which EPBC listed flora and fauna species are known to occur or could potentially occur, based on the studies already undertaken for the project and pre-construction surveys in any situation where those studies are incomplete;
  Likely impacts of construction and operation on EPBC listed flora and fauna species;
  Site-specific mechanisms to avoid and/or mitigate impacts on the species;
  Consideration of the need for offsets in the event of any unforseen impacts on EPBC listed flora and fauna species which can not be appropriately avoided or mitigated; and
  Proposed monitoring and adaptive management programs.
  
  The strategy should address all alignment options under consideration for all components of the project including the transfer pipeline and power supply and may be in the form of separate strategies for the desalination plant, the transfer pipeline and the power supply components of the project.
  A strategy must not be inconsistent with any relevant EPBC Act threatened species recovery plan approved at the approval decision date.
  Construction of any component of the project may not commence until the Minister has approved the strategy relating to that component. An approved strategy must be implemented in the timeframes specified in the strategy.19/03/2009There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
