within 6 months after the commencement of the action, provide funds to the DEC for the acquisition of the offset as described on pages 6 - 8 of the Eco Logical Australia report Catalina Residential Development Assessment Documentation Further Information dated March 2011, and the offset as described on page 3 of a letter by Tamala Park Regional Council dated 23 June 2011; or
if the abovementioned offsets cannot be acquired, the person taking the action must provide details of an alternative offset package to the Department. Any alternative offset package must include one or more land parcels that contain a total of at least 420 ha of Carnaby's Black Cockatoo foraging habitat and 66 ha of Carnaby's Black Cockatoo potential breeding habitat. If the Department considers that an alternative offset package does not provide sufficient Carnaby's Black Cockatoo habitat to compensate for the impacts of the action, then the person taking the action must provide details of further alternative offset package to the Department. Once the written approval of the Department has been obtained for an alternative offset package, the person taking the action must provide sufficient funds to DEC to acquire the land parcel(s) in the offset package within 6 months of the Department's written approval.10/08/2011There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
