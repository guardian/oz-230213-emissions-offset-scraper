10. Construction and training activities may only be undertaken in accordance with the Defence environmental assessment process as described in the PER and with reference to the CEA environmental management framework. If an environmental assessment identifies any residual impacts on matters protected under the EPBC Act, the approval holder must provide to the Minister for approval:

a report of the environmental assessment in question including a copy of Defences environmental assessment;
the corresponding construction environmental management plan (CEMP) if one has been prepared; and
an evaluation, with reference to the EPBC Act offsets policy, of whether any offset (compensation) is required.

Where an offset is required, the approval holder must prepare an environmental offset strategy (EOS) in accordance with the EPBC Act offsets policy and in consultation with the relevant agencies within the South Australian Government.
The construction or training activity must not commence until the Minister has approved it on the basis of any environmental assessment, CEMP or EOS provided, and imposed any additional environmental protection measures that are deemed necessary. Such plans and measures must be implemented as approved.5/12/2013There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
