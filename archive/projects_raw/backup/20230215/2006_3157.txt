To ensure the ongoing protection of EPBC listed flora and fauna species, the person taking the action must prepare and submit for approval a Habitat Management Plan (HMP). The HMP is to encompass the wildlife corridor rehabilitation areas identified in Figure 7.11 of the EIS, the areas of habitat to the north of the dam that are to be managed for conservation as described on page 7-99 and identified in Figure 5-4 of the EIS and all areas covered by the Vegetation Offset Proposal described in Schedule A of the Coordinator-General's Report on pages 110-112.

The HMP must:

describe the location, size and current land tenure of all areas covered by the HMP;
include an analysis, to be completed within 6 months of the date of this approval, of the current habitat value of the above areas for threatened species and communities listed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999;
describe the ongoing management arrangements that will be applied to those areas to maintain and enhance their habitat value, taking into account approved conservation advice and specific threats including but not limited to fire regimes, pest species and impacts resulting from use for recreational or grazing purposes; and
be submitted for the Ministers approval within 12 months of the date of this approval.


The HMP is to be implemented and maintained for a minimum period of 10 years following the approval of the HMP. After this period, the HMP must continue to be implemented unless otherwise agreed by the Minister.
The person taking the action must submit a report of activities undertaken in accordance with the HMP for the 12 months following the approval of the HMP. The first report must be submitted within 14 months of the date of approval of the HMP. Thereafter reports must be submitted on activities undertaken in accordance with the HMP for each subsequent two year period, unless otherwise agreed by the Minister in writing. The reports must be submitted within two months of the end of each two year period.

Each report should describe the location and nature of activities undertaken, the purpose and expected outcomes of those activities, any observed changes in habitat values since the commencement of the HMP and strategies that will be implemented to continually improve the management arrangements that apply to the HMP areas.24/11/2008There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
