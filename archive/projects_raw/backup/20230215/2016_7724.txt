Legally secure at least 847.98 ha of land at the Aroona Offset Site and commence management activities prior to undertaking any clearing at the development area.
Within 20 business days of legally securing at least 847.98 ha of land at the Aroona Offset Site, provide the Department with:


written evidence demonstrating that the Aroona Offset Site has been legally secured;
legal security documentation;
offset attributes; andshapefiles of the Aroona Offset Site.23/12/202106Baseline survey information 
By the end of year 1, the approval holder must complete baseline surveys of the entire Aroona Offset Site. The baseline surveys must be conducted by a suitably qualified field ecologist in accordance with a scientifically valid, robust, and repeatable methodology, and include the following:

The detailed baseline habitat quality assessment data for each operational management unit as provided in the preliminary documentation;
The vegetation condition attributes for each Regional Ecosystem;
The number and condition of Grey-headed Flying-fox winter or spring flowering foraging species across each assessment plot at the Aroona Offset Site.;
The Species Stocking Rate;
The extent of weed cover;
The number or abundance of non-native predators and non-native herbivores across, and where possible surrounding, the Aroona Offset Site;
The number of Koala mortalities attributable to non-native predators; and
The baseline conditions in respect of each of the outcomes specified in conditions 8 – 18.28/09/202007Within three (3) months of the end of year 1, the approval holder must publish all survey data (including survey methodology and dates) from the baseline surveys required under condition 6 including a program to monitor and report on progress against the ecological outcomes specified in conditions 8–18 on the website and provide a copy of this information to the Department.28/09/202008Pest and weed management 
The approval holder must demonstrate a 90% reduction in the number or abundance of non-native predators and non-native herbivores by the end of year 5, relative to the number or abundance identified during the baseline surveys, and ensure that the number or abundance of non-native predators and non-native herbivores are then maintained at, or reduced below, the year 5 number or abundance for the rest of the period of effect of the approval.28/09/202009Within 6 months of the end of year 5 and thereafter within 6 months of each fifth anniversary of the date when the Aroona Offset Site is legally secured, the approval holder must publish the outcomes of condition 8 and provide a copy of the outcomes to the Department within 5 business days of being published.28/09/202010The approval holder must demonstrate the extent of weed cover across the whole Aroona Offset Site is:

Less than 25% by the end of year 5; and
Less than 5% by the end of year 10, and then maintained for the remaining period of effect of this approval.28/09/202011Within 6 months of the end of year 5 and thereafter within 6 months of each fifth anniversary of the date when the Aroona Offset Site is legally secured, the approval holder must publish the outcomes of condition 10 and provide a copy of the outcomes to the Department within 5 business days of being published.28/09/202012Stock Management 
The approval holder must install fauna friendly stock exclusion fencing around Operational management unit 3 by the end of year 1.28/09/202013To facilitate the outcomes prescribed under conditions 15 – 18, the approval holder must:

Only permit grazing at the Aroona Offset Site for the purposes of bushfire hazard reduction.
Ensure that all livestock are excluded from Operational management unit 3 for a minimum of 5 years, or until a suitably qualified independent expert has determined that planted Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox feed trees are of sufficient size to withstand impact from cattle.
The approval holder must provide the Department with a report from the suitably qualified independent expert verifying that planted Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox feed trees are of sufficient size to withstand impact from cattle.
Ensure that any grazing is managed so as to prevent the risk of injury or mortality of Koalas.28/09/202014Before each annual anniversary of the date when the Aroona Offset Site is legally secured, until the end of year 5, and thereafter before each fifth anniversary of the date when the Aroona Offset Site is legally secured, the approval holder must submit to the Department a monitoring report in respect of the period since the period covered by the previous report or since the date when the Aroona Offset Site was legally secured, which includes:

An analysis of how cattle grazing at the Aroona Offset Site has facilitated and/or impacted the achievement of outcomes prescribed under conditions 15 – 18;
Frequency, duration and location of grazing, and stock density for each grazing period;
Details of any injury or mortality of individual Koalas;
The timing and frequency of monitoring undertaken; and
Details of corrective actions already undertaken and/or proposed to be undertaken in the event of injury or mortality of individual Koalas as a result of grazing, and/or if monitoring demonstrates the outcomes under 15 - 18 are not achievable.28/09/2020There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
