3. The person taking the action must, within six (6) months of commencement of the stage 1 works as identified in table 1 and Appendix A, submit in writing a Biodiversity Offset Management Plan (BOMP) for the stage 1 impact area for the Minister’s approval to compensate for any authorised impacts on protected matters. The approved stage 1 BOMP must be implemented.18/03/2016055. The BOMP for each stage must:
a) define the objectives and outcomes of the BOMP
b) comply with the principles of the EPBC Act Environmental Offsets Policy 
c) consider all relevant conservation advices, recovery plans and or threat abatement plans 
d) provide a completed offsets assessment guide
e) provide maps of the proposed offset sites
f) define the baseline condition of the EPBC Act listed threatened species and communities within the stage 1 impact area or stage 2 impact area (depending on which stage the BOMP is for) prior to commencement
g) define the baseline condition of the proposed offset prior to submission of the BOMP
h) define the performance goals for offsets relevant to the project stage
i) identify the timing and frequency of monitoring to determine whether the offset strategy is meeting performance goals or whether the offset strategy needs to be adaptively managed
j) identify clear and concise indicators of whether performance goals are being achieved
k) identify appropriate corrective actions if the proposed performance goals are not achieved
l) clearly state the position of persons responsible for actions under the BOMP
m) outline timelines for review noting that any revisions to the BOMP must be approved by the Minister before implementation18/03/2016066. Prior to the commencement of stage 1, and prior to the submission of the stage 1 BOMP (described in condition 3), the person taking the action must acquire and commence the management of at least 80% of the land for offsets proposed in the stage 1 BOMP. The quality of the environmental offsets must not fall below the baseline identified in the BOMP submitted in condition 3 unless the loss of condition can be attributed to an environmental event. The person taking the action must employ mitigations and adaptive management to minimise the impacts of environmental events upon offsets. This condition lapses if the Minister approves the stage 1 BOMP.18/03/2016077. The person taking the action must register a legally binding conservation mechanism over the offset areas approved by the Minister in the BOMP within 3 years of the commencement of the relevant stage (stage 1 and or stage 2) identified in table 1 and shown in Appendix A. The legally binding conservation mechanism over the offset areas must not be removed unless another legally binding conservation mechanism is in place.18/03/2016There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
