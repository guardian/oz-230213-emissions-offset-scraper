To compensate for the clearing of 65 ha of Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) (combined populations of Qld, NSW and the ACT) habitat as specified in condition 1, the approval holder must provide environmental offsets consistent with the Environmental offsets policy.28/05/202003The approval holder must submit an Offset Area Management Plan (OAMP) prepared by a suitably qualified ecologist for the written approval of the Minister. The approval holder must not commence the action until the OAMP has been approved by the Minister. The approved OAMP must be implemented.28/05/202004The approval holder must ensure the OAMP required under condition 3 includes the following:

details to demonstrate how the offset compensates for the clearance of Koala(Phascolarctos cinereus) (combined populations of Qld, NSW and the ACT) habitat inaccordance with the Environmental offsets policy;
a description of the offset, including location, size, condition, environmental values presentand surrounding land uses;
relevant baseline data and other supporting evidence, including results from field validationsurveys and quantifiable ecological data, that documents the presence of the Koala and thequality of the Koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) (combined populations of Qld, NSW and theACT) habitat within the offset area;
an assessment of site habitat quality using a method agreed to in writing by theDepartment;
details of how the offset area will provide connectivity with other habitats and biodiversitycorridors and/or will contribute to a larger strategic offset for the Koala;
a description and maps (including shapefiles) to clearly define the location and boundariesof the offset areas, accompanied by the offset attributes (including physical address of theoffset areas, coordinates of the boundary points in decimal degrees and the size of theenvironmental offsets in hectares);
specific offset completion criteria derived from the site habitat quality to demonstrate theimprovement in the habitat quality for Koala in the offset area over the period of effect ofthis approval;
details of the management measures (including timing, frequency, duration and method ofoutcome measurement), to be carried out to meet the offset completion criteria set incondition 4.g;The management measures must specify activities that will be prohibited in the offsetarea(s), including (but not limited to) mining/exploration, development and alternate landuses.The management measures proposed must be consistent with the EnvironmentalManagement Plan Guidelines and the Approved conservation advice.
performance criteria that set targets at 5-yearly intervals for expected progress towards thecompletion criteria set in condition 4.g;
details of the nature, timing and frequency of monitoring to inform progress againstachieving the 5-yearly interim milestones (the frequency of monitoring must be sufficient totrack progress towards each set of milestones, and sufficient to determine whether theoffset area is likely to achieve those milestones in adequate time to implement all necessarycorrective actions);
proposed timing for the submission of monitoring reports which provide evidencedemonstrating whether the interim milestones have been achieved;
timing for the implementation of corrective actions if monitoring activities indicate theinterim milestones have not been achieved;
a risk analysis and a risk management and mitigation strategy for all risks to the successfulimplementation of the OAMP and timely achievement of the offset completion criteria set incondition 4.g, including for if the offset fails to achieve and maintain the completion criteria;and
the proposed legal mechanism for legally securing the offset area, such that legal securityremains in force over the offset area for at least the period of effect of this approval.28/05/2020There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
