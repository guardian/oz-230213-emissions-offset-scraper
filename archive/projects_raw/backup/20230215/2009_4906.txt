legally secure for the life of the approval an offset area(s) containing Malleefowl habitat that is equal to or greater in size and quality to the Malleefowl habitat to be cleared within the development envelope; and
submit for the Minister's approval, a Malleefowl Offset Strategy detailing the environmental attributes of the offset area(s). The Malleefowl Offset Strategy must:

specify the proposed environmental offset area(s) including, but not limited to:

location,
proximity to high-value ecological corridors,
tenure,
suitability to offset impacts to the Malleefowl, and
baseline condition quantified using quality score for area of habitat, and if applicable, the number of Malleefowl individuals present.


provide evidence of the capacity of the offset site(s) to meet the requirements and intent of this condition, and the principles of the EPBC Act Environmental Offsets Policy (2012),
detail when and how the offset area(s) will be protected in perpetuity under a conservation mechanism,
demonstrate the adequacy of the proposed conservation mechanism proposed to legally secure the offset area(s), and describe any means by which a future site owner may seek to amend or remove the mechanism,
provide a completed EPBC Act Offsets Assessment Guide (offset calculator) for the Malleefowl offset area(s), and
present evidence substantiating inputs to the offset calculator, including:

confidence in result, time until ecological benefit, start and future condition (scale of 1 - 10), and risk of loss,
the specific components used to derive start and future condition (i.e. stocking rate, site context and site condition) of the Malleefowl habitat at the offset site, and current condition of the Malleefowl habitat at the impact site, and
set-out in general terms potential offset management activities considered feasible to achieve future condition and time until ecological benefit.





If the Minister approves the Malleefowl Offset Strategy then the Malleefowl Offset Strategy must be implemented. The approval holder must not commence the action unless the Minister has approved the Malleefowl Offset Strategy in writing.10/04/2019There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
