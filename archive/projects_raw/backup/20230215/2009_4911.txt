The acquisition and protection in perpetuity of a sufficient number of hectares of land, to achieve a minimum of six hectares retained for every hectare cleared. The land protected must be of similar species composition, density and quality (or better) as the native vegetation on the land cleared.
Details of the location, funding and tenure arrangements, and management of the land (including weed management) to be used as the offset.
Details of on-site mitigation measures. This must include details of revegetation/rehabilitation of all cleared areas not required for the operation of the wind farm. The land revegetated/rehabilitated must result in a similar species composition and density to that of pre-clearing native vegetation in the project area. Revegetation/rehabilitation must occur within 12 months of the date construction of the wind farm was completed. If after two years from the date of revegetation/rehabilitation, a survival rate of 90% of the revegetation/rehabilitation areas is not achieved, all revegetation/rehabilitation areas that have not survived must be replaced with the same species composition within 12 months, and maintained for a minimum of a further two years.

The Milyeannup Wind Farm Offset Plan must be submitted to and approved by the Department prior to construction commencing. The Milyeannup Wind Farm Offset Plan must include timeframes for implementation. The approved Milyeannup Wind Farm Offset Plan must be implemented.19/10/2010There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
