To offset the loss of nesting habitat for the south-eastern subspecies of the Red-tailed Black-cockatoo, the person taking the action must protect the balance of the `Argyle' property (as indicated in ANNEXURE 2) as a River Red Gum woodland and wetland community.

place covenants on the title for sections 163, 164, 165 and 166 to secure the balance of the `Argyle' property as a conservation reserve in perpetuity;
implement the management actions outlined in the plan for Reinstatement of Red Gum Woodland to a Wetland Conservation Area, Penola, South Australia; and
demonstrate the establishment of the foundations of a functioning River Red Gum woodland within 10 years of the date of this approval.

Salvaged hollows are to be translocated to the area described in Condition 2 and attached to existing River Red Gums within this area.
