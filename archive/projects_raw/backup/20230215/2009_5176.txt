Provisions to undertake targeted pre-construction surveys for threatened flora species and Cassowary fruiting trees within the construction footprint of the proposed development;
Measures to ensure no removal or impact to endangered or vulnerable EPBC listed species identified in the targeted surveys as required in condition 9(a);
Measures to offset the loss of fruiting trees as a food source to the Southern Cassowary at a ratio of 5 plants for every one plant removed or impacted; and
Measures to mitigate and enhance habitat for the Southern Cassowary, Littoral Rainforest and Coastal Vine Thickets of Eastern Australia, Chingia Australis and Gardenia actinocarpa.

This plan must be submitted to the department for approval prior to commencement of construction. The approved plan must be implemented.14/12/2010There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
