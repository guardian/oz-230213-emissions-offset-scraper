66. The person taking the action must submit for the Minister's approval a Biodiversity Offset Strategy within 12 months of the date of this approval, or as otherwise approved in writing by the Minister. The strategy must address the residual impacts to EPBC Act listed dugong, dolphins, migratory birds, marine turtles, cetaceans and sawfish from construction and production, including dredging and noise impacts and the increased recreation use of the area and its associated impacts to species. The offset commitments are to include the following:

The establishment and operation of a regional Indigenous Sea Ranger Program to be operated out of the Onslow area. The Program should fully fund all costs associated with supporting annually, a minimum of 5 full-time equivalent field ranger positions and a full-time lead coordinator position for the life of the project. The Program should seek to address the threats to EPBC Act listed threatened and migratory species, protect the coastline and tidal creeks, remove marine debris, and play a key role in assisting Chevron to ensure compliance with the Wheatstone Environment Protection Code of Conduct.
Provide funding for research and implementation of ecological studies on seagrass in the Project area or other areas in the Pilbara region.
Provide funding to a recognised research institution for research and development of sawfish-appropriate fishways to remove barriers to the movement of sawfish in riverine habitats.
The design, fit or retrofitting of 5 sawfish-appropriate fishways or alternative measures to remove barriers to sawfish passage in riverine habitat in the Pilbara and/or Kimberley regions, as identified through the research referred to in 66 (c).
Provide funding to a recognised conservation or natural resource management organisation to develop and implement a 5-year Threatened Species Information and Protection Program comprising of educational materials and interpretive signage and actions that seek to discharge human access to sensitive or important habitat - including marine turtle nesting beaches or migratory bird nesting, roosting or feeding sites on offshore islands.
A suitable offset area, for the portion of Dwarf Desert Spike-rush habitat, or likely habitat as identified in condition 60, that is cleared from the project area in excess of 30% of suitable habitat, within a 10 kilometre radius of the outer edge of the disturbance footprint.30/04/2013There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
