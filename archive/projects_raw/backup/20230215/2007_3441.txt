In order to minimise the impact on the EPBC listed endangered Carnaby’s Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) and the EPBC listed vulnerable Baudin’s Black Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudinii) the following offsets must be implemented within the timeframes stipulated, including:

Documentation confirming the vesting of the 112ha Roberts Block offset area identified in Annexure 1 must be provided to the Department by 21 December 2016.
A conservation covenant in perpetuity must be placed over the 9.95ha cockatoo habitat offset area to the north of Roberts Block identified in Annexure 1 by 30 June 2016. Documentation confirming the covenant is in place must be provided to the Department by 30 June 2016.
Creation of a vegetation link, which includes cockatoo suitable species, from Roberts Block to the State Forest must be commenced by 31 October 2013. The person taking the action must provide the Department with documentation confirming the vesting of the link by 21 December 2016.
Prior to clearing of any potential cockatoo hollows the person taking the action must inspect the hollows. No tree that contains an active nest can be cleared until the young have fledged.
Three nesting hollows must be provided for every potential cockatoo hollow removed during the vegetation clearance of the proposal site using salvaged cockatoo hollows and/or artificial hollows. These hollows must be replaced in suitable trees adjacent to the State Forest within one month of their removal. The person taking the action must provide the Department with a map detailing the position of the replaced hollows and the hollows must be monitored on a six monthly basis to check usage rates, check for feral species and to provide any maintenance required. The nesting boxes are to be monitored and maintained for the life of the mine and incorporated in the final closure plan.14/09/2016There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
