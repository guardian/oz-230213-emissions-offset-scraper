The person taking the action must:

within 3 months of the date of this approval, secure the tenure of the protected land by co-signing with Trust for Nature and the protected land owner a Credit Trading Agreement. The Department must be provided with a copy of the signed Credit Trading Agreement within 2 weeks of its signature by all parties;
within 6 months of the date of this approval, ensure that a Deed of Covenant for the protected land is executed with Trust for Nature and is registered on the title documents of the protected land. The Department must be provided with a copy of the signed Deed of Covenant within 2 weeks of its signature by all parties;

The final Offset Management Plan must be approved by the Department and must:

provide for the conservation, maintenance and increase of Spiny Rice- flower populations on the protected land and include measures to rehabilitate and maintain habitat important to Spiny Rice-flower, enhance Spiny Rice-flower recruitment, control weed species and pest animals, control access to the protected land, control grazing activities and monitor the status of Spiny Rice-flower populations and condition of Spiny Rice-flower habitat;
include provisions and measures to ensure that actions taken to conserve, manage and protect Spiny Rice-flower populations and habitat have no detrimental impact on the habitat and populations of other EPBC Act listed species and ecological communities that are identified in the Offset Management Plan as occurring on the protected land; and
provide for corrective action and contingency measures to be developed and implemented, where monitoring of the protected land under the Offset Management Plan indicates a decrease in the population of Spiny Rice-flower plants or degradation of Spiny Rice-flower habitat.

The approved Offset Management Plan must be implemented.2/06/2009There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
