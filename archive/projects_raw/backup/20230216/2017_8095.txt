No. . sort ascendingDetails. sort descendingStart Date. sort descending02To compensate for the clearing of 62.79 hectares of Koala habitat and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat within the development area of the project site, the approval holder must:

legally secure the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site prior to the commencement of the action;

within 20 business days of legally securing the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site, provide the Department with evidence of the date both sites were legally secured and shape files of the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site.12/02/201903Within 6 months of the commencement of the action, the approval holder must complete and provide the Department with the results and dates of the following surveys:

baseline Koala density survey;
baseline Grey-headed Flying Fox presence survey;
baseline Koala food tree survey;
baseline Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging tree survey;
baseline non-native plant survey;
baseline survey of non-native Koala predator.
Note: The surveys must be conducted by a suitably qualified person, consistent with the Department’s approved survey guidelines and designed to provide results that are representative of the entire areas of the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site12/02/201904To ensure an increase in the number of available Koala food trees at the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site, the approval holder must:

within 12 months of the commencement of the action, commence the planting at the Peak Crossing offset site and the Burnett Creek offset site of seed, sapling or tube stock (or equivalent) tree species suitable for the eventual establishment of new Koala food trees at the Peak Crossing offset site and the Burnett Creek offset site;
within 5 years of the commencement of the action, complete the planting of the following number of seed, sapling or tube stock (or equivalent) tree species suitable for the eventual establishment of new Koala food trees:

at least 15,000 at the Peak Crossing offset site;
at least 2,500 at the Burnett Creek offset site.


implement measures to ensure the ongoing maintenance and survival over the life of the approval of at least 90 per cent of the planted seed, sapling or tube stock (or equivalent) tree species at the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site; 
inform the Department in writing of the commencement and completion of the planting of seed, sapling or tube stock (or equivalent) tree species at the Peak Crossing offset site and the Burnett Creek offset site;
ensure the planting, monitoring and maintenance of planting of seed, sapling or tube stock (or equivalent) tree species for the eventual establishment of new Koala food trees is undertaken by a suitably qualified person.12/02/201905Within 10 years of commencement of the action, ensure at least 90% of non-native plants, relative to the baseline non-native plant survey, are removed from the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site. This level of non-native plant cover must be maintained until the requirements of condition 6 have been met.12/02/201906Within 15 years of the date of the baseline Koala food tree survey and baseline Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging tree survey ensure the following outcomes are achieved relative to the baselines determined by the baseline Koala food tree survey and baseline Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging tree survey:

20 per cent increase in the number of Koala food trees and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging trees at the Peak Crossing offset site;

5 per cent increase in the number of Koala food trees and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging trees at the Burnett Creek offset site.12/02/201908Demonstrate a reduction, maintained for nine consecutive years from the date of completion of the baseline survey of non-native Koala predators, in the number of non-native Koala predators over both the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site, relative to the baseline determined by the baseline survey of non-native Koala predators.12/02/201909Offset Management Plan
The approval holder must, within 6 months of commencement of the action, submit to the Department a Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox Offset Management Plan for the Minister’s approval. The Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox Offset Management Plan must address both the Peak Crossing offset site and Burnett Creek offset site, be written in accordance with the Department’s Environmental Management Plan Guidelines and be consistent with the EPBC Act Environmental Offset Policy. The approved Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox Offset Management Plan (or a revised version if approved by the Minister) must be implemented.12/02/201911Variation of Plan
If, at any time during the life of the approval, the Minister is not satisfied that any of the requirements or outcomes under conditions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are likely to be achieved or maintained, the Minister may request (in writing) further evidence from the approval holder on how the requirements or outcomes of these conditions will be achieved or maintained. If requested by the Minister, the approval holder must:

provide a report to the Department that documents the cause of the potential non-compliance, the corrective actions to be taken (including timeframes for reporting to the Department the success of those actions) and the contingency measures that will be implemented to prevent further occurrences;
revise the Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox Offset Management Plan, in consultation with a suitably qualified person and within a timeframe determined by the Minister, to include the corrective actions and contingency measures;
submit the revised Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox Offset Management Plan to the Department for the Minister’s approval, within a timeframe determined by the Minister;
inform the Department in writing of when and how the relevant contingency measures and corrective actions have been implemented.12/02/2019There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
