32. To protect the Water Mouse (Xeromys myoides), the proponent must submit to the Minister an Environmental Management Plan (the Water Mouse Environmental Management Plan) which must include:

results of a pre-clearance survey undertaken at the appropriate time and season for the species;
a map of the location of potential habitat for the Water Mouse in proximity to marine facilities;
measures that will be employed to avoid impacts on the Water Mouse or its potential habitat; and
if impacts on the Water Mouse or its potential habitat are unavoidable, propose offsets to compensate for the impacts.

 Note: To avoid doubt, if a condition of another approval held by the proponent requires a Water Mouse Environmental Management Plan, the proponent may simultaneously meet the relevant requirements of both conditions by submitting a single plan. The plan may also be prepared in consultation with the Gladstone Ports Corporation in accordance with conditions imposed for the Gladstone Western Basin Dredging and Disposal Project (EPBC 2009/4904).22/10/2010There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
