To compensate for the significant residual impact of clearing 180.16 ha of Koala habitat and Grey-Headed Flying-fox foraging habitat within the development area, the approval holder must implement the Offset Management Plan for the duration of this approval. In particular, the approval holder must:
a) legally secure at least 187.2 ha of land at the Offset Receiving Site and commence management activities prior to the commencement of the action; and
b) within 20 business days of legally securing the Offset Receiving Site, provide the Department with written evidence demonstrating that the Offset Receiving Site has been legally secured (i.e. legal security documentation), and shapefiles and the offset attributes.30/10/202007Prior to the commencement of the action, the approval holder must complete baseline surveys of the entire area at the Offset Receiving Site. The baseline surveys must be conducted by a suitably qualified field ecologist in accordance with a scientifically valid, robust, and repeatable methodology and determine in detail the:
a) vegetation condition attributes for each Regional Ecosystem present;
b) the extent, location, condition and quality of Koala habitat and Grey-Headed Flying-fox foraging habitat;
c) extent of weed cover throughout the Offset Receiving Site; and
d) abundance of non-native predators and non-native herbivores.30/10/202008For the protection of the Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox, the approval holder must achieve the following outcomes at the Offset Receiving Site:
a) undertake ecological works to restore the Regional Ecosystems as specified in the Offset Management Plan;
b) the rehabilitation success criteria by year 10, as a result of planting and maintaining trees of appropriate species, and once the rehabilitation success criteria are achieved maintain them for the duration of the approval;
c) by year 5 the extent of weed cover at the Offset Receiving Site is reduced by 95% relative to the extent of weed cover determined by the baseline surveys, and subsequently the extent of weed cover is maintained at 5% or less of the extent of weed cover determined by the baseline surveys;
d) by year 5 the abundance of non-native predators and non-native herbivores at the Offset Receiving Site is reduced by 90% relative to the numbers of non-native predators and non-native herbivores determined by the baseline surveys, and subsequently the abundance of non-native predators and non-native herbivores at the Offset Receiving Site is maintained at 10% or less of the abundance of non-native predators and non-native herbivores at the Offset Receiving Site determined by the baseline surveys; and
e) the Koala carrying capacity exceeds 50 individuals prior to 30 June 2045.30/10/202009Monitoring 
The approval holder must have an independent suitably qualified field ecologist undertake an assessment as to whether the outcomes required in Conditions 3(f), 3(g) and 8 have been, or are likely to be, achieved in the project area and Offset Receiving Site within three months prior to the end of each of Year 5, Year 10 and Year 15. The findings of each assessment must be published on the website within three months of the end of the period in which each review was undertaken and be provided to the Department at least five business days before being published on the website.30/10/202010If, at any time during the period of effect of the approval, the Minister is not satisfied that any of the requirements or outcomes required under Conditions 3(f), 3(g) and 8 have been or are likely to be achieved or maintained, the Minister may require the approval holder to submit a corrective action plan for the project area and/or Offset Receiving Site for approval by the Minister, specifying new requirements to implement corrective actions and/or to monitor, manage, avoid, mitigate, offset, record and/or report on, impacts to the Koala and Grey-headed Flying-fox.30/10/202011The Minister may specify a timeframe in which the approval holder must submit the corrective action plan to the Department, and may specify that the corrective action plan must be prepared or reviewed by an independent suitably qualified field ecologist.30/10/202012If the Minister writes to the approval holder stating that he/she considers that the corrective action plan for the project area and/or Offset Receiving site is not likely to achieve the outcomes required under Conditions 3(f), 3(g) and 8, then the approval holder must not commence construction of any stage of the staged land management in which construction has not already commenced and must not register titles until such time as the corrective action plan is approved by the Minister in writing.30/10/2020There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
