To compensate for the residual significant impacts of clearing Ghost Bat (Macroderma gigas) habitat and Pilbara Leaf-nosed Bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia (Pilbara form)) habitat, the approval holder must within six months of the date of this approval, submit an Offset Strategy for the Minister’s written approval. The Offset Strategy must be consistent with the principles of the EPBC Act Environmental Offsets Policy and must:

specify the approach for providing offsets for the clearing of 507 ha of Ghost Bat habitat and 507 ha of Pilbara Leaf-nosed Bat habitat;
identify threats for the Ghost Bat and Pilbara Leaf-nosed Bat;
nominate detailed offset projects that will realise a conservation benefit for the Ghost Bat and the Pilbara Leaf-nosed Bat in accordance with relevant approved conservation advice, recovery plans and threat abatement plans and regional conservation plans;
if the proposed Offset Strategy includes offset(s) that are not land acquisition, specify a financial commitment to offset projects of at least $3,000 AUD (exclusive of GST) per hectare of Ghost Bat habitat cleared and, in addition, at least $821.00 AUD (exclusive of GST) per hectare of Pilbara Leaf-nosed bat habitat cleared. Payments in respect of this commitment must be adjusted in accordance with the CPI released in each calendar year from the date of this approval decision until the date on which any particular payment is made;
specify the location and nature of each proposed offset, along with detailed objectives, budget, timeframes, performance and completion criteria for evaluating conservation outcomes, monitoring and reporting requirements;
include a description of the potential risks to the successful implementation of each proposed offset (including but not limited to environmental, administrative, financial, and governance risks);
include a description of the measures that will be implemented to mitigate risks associated with each proposed offset and a description of the contingency measures that will be implemented if triggers arise or completion criteria are not met;
include processes to adaptively manage proposed offsets; and
include a justification for how the proposed offsets meet the EPBC Act Environmental Offsets Policy.

The approval holder must implement the approved Offset Strategy. The approval holder must implement the proposed offsets under the Offset Strategy within two months of the approval of the Offset Strategy, or another time as agreed in writing by the Department.18/06/2020There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
