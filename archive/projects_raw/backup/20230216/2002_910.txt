To offset impacts to listed threatened species, the person taking the action must prepare and submit an Offset Management Plan (OMP) for the management of the offset area. The OMP must be prepared in consultation with WA DEC and include, though not be limited to:

a description clearly defining the location and boundaries of the offset area, as specified in Condition 6, which must be accompanied with the offset attributes;
revegetation and rehabilitation measures to be undertaken in the 'Degraded' area of the existing Kemerton Nature Reserve, the 11 ha area identified as 'Rehabilitation' at Attachment A;
details of Peppermint (Agonis flexuosa) replanting proposed to occur within the offset area, including locations and maps;
feral animal and weed controls, including dieback (Phytopthora cinnamomi) management, to be implemented within the offset area;
details of fencing to be undertaken to exclude feral animals from the project area;
mapping of areas where management activities are planned;
monitoring and survey measures to be utilised, including timing and reporting commitments;
performance indicators for successful achievement of these commitments;
funding allocations and schedule for management actions;
corrective or contingency measures if performance indicators are not achieved; and,
roles and responsibilities of contractors, staff and the person taking the action, prior to, during and following any rehabilitation and revegetation works undertaken in the offset area. 

The OMP must be submitted to the Department and approved within 18 months of commencement of mining operations. If the Minister approves the OMP, the approved OMP must be implemented.
Note: If a condition of another approval held by the person taking the action requires submission of a plan that meets the requirements of Condition 5, the person taking the action may simultaneously meet the requirements of both conditions by submittinga single plan.4/04/2013066. The person taking the action must, within 18 months of the commencement of mining operations, provide the Department with written evidence, including a certificate of title, that at least 845 ha of land, being the offset area, has been transferred to the Western Australian conservation estate. The certificate of title must state that WA DEC is the agency responsible for the land contained within the offset area. If the Department does not receive written evidence that the offset area has been ceded to WA DEC within 18 months of the commencement of mining operations, the person taking the action must not clear any further vegetation, until the Department receives written evidence that the offset area has been transferred to WA DEC.4/04/2013There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
