For the better protection of roosting habitat for the Pilbara Leaf-nosed Bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia (Pilbara form)) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, the person taking the action must ensure that no impact occurs to the structural integrity of Cave 26 on Mesa 3 at Poondano Central at Appendix 1. To ensure this outcome is achieved, the person taking the action must monitor the structural integrity of Cave 26 throughout mining operations on Mesa 3 in accordance with the methodology outlined in the Fauna Management and Monitoring Plan specified in condition 12.
In the event that the monitoring indicates that structural damage has occurred to Cave 26, the person taking the action must:

Report such findings to the department within 7 days of the damage being identified;
Provide written advice to the department, within 21 days of the damage being identified, stating:

the direct cause of the damage; and
actions and associated timelines proposed to remediate the damage.


If actions cannot be undertaken to remediate the damage and Cave 26 ceases to provide suitable habitat for the Leaf-nosed Bat, then an offset, for approval by the Minister, must be provided within 2 months of the identification of the damage. The offset must be for the long term protection of habitat that maximises the conservation of the Pilbara Leaf-nosed Bat Pilbara bioregion. The approved offset must be implemented. All works at Poondano Central must cease if an acceptable offset has not been provided to the Minister within 2 months.24/08/2011There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
