Within six months of this approval being issued, the person taking the action must commence habitat restoration and revegetation works on no less than 3ha of conservation lands as vested with the Western Australian Department of the Environment and Conservation (DEC). These lands are within reserve number 41597, located approximately 2km south-east of Lot 1, with access via Swamp Hen Lane. Revegetation must occur in accordance with the habitat restoration and management processes recommended by DEC, including recommended species mix and planting rates. The person taking the action must provide an agreed financial contribution towards the habitat restoration and revegetation works. The person taking the action must ensure that:

A qualified rehabilitation/regeneration specialist conducts the rehabilitation and regeneration works. The specialist must be approved by the Department in writing prior to the commencement of rehabilitation and regeneration works;
Fencing is erected around the site to prevent access by domestic animals and increase the effectiveness of pest (including fox) control;
Habitat restoration, regeneration and management work includes all vegetation layers (including canopy, mid-storey and under-storey);
Monitoring and evaluation of the habitat restoration and management processes is undertaken 1, 5 and 10 years after the date of this approval. At years 1, 5 and 10, the person taking the action must commission an independent qualified ecologist to prepare a report detailing the success or deficiencies of the outcomes for Western Ringtail Possums, and identify remedial actions and commitments to implement these actions. Outcomes reported on must include rehabilitation and regeneration (including the survival rate of plantings), tree health and size, remedial actions undertaken for plant loss, effectiveness of weed control, effectiveness of predator control, Western Ringtail Possum surveys, surveys for pests such as rabbits and foxes, and overall quality of habitat for WesternRingtail Possum foraging and breeding. This report must be provided to the Department within three months of the completion of monitoring and evaluation. The independent ecologist must be approved by the Department in writing prior to the commencement of monitoring and evaluation;
If monitoring results at years 1, 5, and 10 indicate a mortality rate of plantings of 30% or greater, replanting must be undertaken to bring the survival rate of all plantings up to at least 70%; and
Within 10 years, a canopy of native Peppermint woodland with an understorey of native species must be established on the 3ha. If monitoring indicates poor health of Peppermints, or low usage of the site by Western Ringtail Possums, then remedial actions must be undertaken including the engagement of an arborist or other appropriate specialist and a Western Ringtail Possum expert. The experts must be approved by the Department in writing prior to the commencement of remedial works.27/11/2007There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
