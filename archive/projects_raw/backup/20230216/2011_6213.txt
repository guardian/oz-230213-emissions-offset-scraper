31. The person taking the action must submit an Offsets Plan to the Minister for approval prior to commencement of dredging and disposal activities. The Offsets Plan must include the following:

Address the loss of seagrass from the dredge area and areas of potential seagrass loss resulting from the dredge plume extent;
Outline the process to undertake actions that will result in a net benefit outcome for the World Heritage Area;
Consider how these offsets will contribute to programs or incentives and align with the broader strategies and programs for the Great Barrier Reef, including Reef Trust 2050;
150% of the the total amount of fine sediments, potentially available for re suspension into the marine environment from the dredging and disposal activities, must be offset by a reduction in the load of fine sediments entering the marine environment from the Burdekin and Don catchments. This can take account of information on the sedimentation of fine sediments as it becomes available;
Monitor and report on performance of the actions undertaken in relation to the targets required at 31(d);
Outline the consultation process undertaken with the GBRMPA in developing the Offsets Plan;
Publish an annual public report outlining how the actions are achieving the targets in 31(d) for the duration of this approval; and
Outline contingency actions and additional management measures to address any deficiencies to meet the targets at 31(d).10/12/20133232.
