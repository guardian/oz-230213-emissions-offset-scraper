14. To offset residual significant impacts as a result of the loss of 1,755 ha of Black Cockatoo, Woylie and Chuditch habitat the person taking the action must prepare and submit a Land Offset Plan3 (LOP) for approval by the Minister. The LOP must (but is not limited to):

Include the identification, acquisition (if required) and timing of placement into a conservation covenant approved by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife Nature Conservation Covenant Program of 2,000 ha of offset land that has vegetation in similar condition to the vegetation being impacted by the proposal. The offset land to be placed under a conservation covenant must contain:

Known foraging and breeding habitat for Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) and Forest Red-tailed Black-Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus banksii naso) and must be within six kilometers of permanent drinking water.
Known foraging habitat for Baudin's Black-Cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus baudinii) and must be within six kilometers of permanent drinking water.
Known habitat for Woylie.
Known foraging and breeding habitat for Chuditch.


Include the identification, acquisition (if required) and timing of placement into a conservation covenant approved by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife Nature Conservation Covenant Program of 470 ha of offset land that has vegetation that can be rehabilitated to a similar condition to the vegetation being impacted by the proposal and must be in addition to the offset land required by condition 14 (a) above.
For offset land requiring rehabilitation, the LOP must identify and detail improvement actions (including monitoring requirements and completion criteria) and a timeframe for the actions to be undertaken to improve the condition of the land to a similar condition to the vegetation being impacted.
Ensure that parcels of land to be placed under a conservation covenant are a minimum of 90 ha in size (should more than one parcel of land be identified as part of the 2,470 ha to be placed under a conservation covenant).
Ensure that parcels of land to be placed under a conservation covenant are within 50 kilometers of the project site.
Detail funding arrangements and timing of funding for rehabilitation activities.

3 Note: If a condition of another approval held by the proponent requires the submission of a plan that meets the requirements of condition 14, the proponent may simulataneously meet the relevant requirements of both conditions by submitting a single plan16/05/2014There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
