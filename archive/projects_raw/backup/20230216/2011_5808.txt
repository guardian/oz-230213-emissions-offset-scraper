To compensate for the loss of Box-Gum Woodland at the project site, within twenty four (24) months of the date of this approval, the approval holder must formally incorporate the offset site into the Isaacs Ridge Nature Reserve for conservation purposes as further prescribed in condition 3.18/03/2014033. For the enduring conservation, management and monitoring of the offset site, the approval holder must engage a suitably qualified person to develop an Offset Management Plan (OMP). The OMP must be submitted to the Minister for approval within six (6) months of the date of this approval. The OMP must include details on:

location of the offset site including clear maps and accompanying shapefiles;
historical, current and intended future ecological values of the offset site, with reference to its claimed offset scores;
management of weeds and pathogens;
management of pests and feral animals;
management of fire (in consideration of ecological requirements as well as protection of life and property);
management of access (including fencing and signage);
active and passive revegetation;
objectives and performance measures in relation to activities described in iii. to vii. (these should make reference where relevant to the claimed offset scores), along with corresponding contingency or remedial measures;
monitoring and reporting measures in relation to activities described in iii. to vii., in consideration of relevant reporting requirements of these conditions of approval;
scheduling and costing estimates for activities described in iii. to vii; and
provisions for the transition of the offset site to the Canberra Nature Park, which includes a statement of commitment by the relevant government agency to ongoing maintenance and associated annual resourcing.

The OMP, as approved, must be implemented for at least the duration of this approval or until the offset site is transferred to the Canberra Nature Park. Until that time, the interim offset management plan must be implemented.18/03/2014There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
