15. Within 12 months of the commencement of pipeline development the proponent must prepare an Offset Plan to provide an offset area for the approved disturbance limits relating to Semi-evergreen vine thickets of the Brigalow Belt (North and South) and Nandewar Bioregions within the project area. The offset area to be secured must be an area of private land which includes at least 19.2 ha of Semi-evergreen vine thickets of the Brigalow Belt (North and South) and Nandewar Bioregions.

The Offset Plan must include details of the offset area including: the timing and arrangements for property acquisition, maps and site description, environmental values relevant to MNES, connectivity with other habitats and biodiversity corridors, a rehabilitation program, and mechanisms for long-term protection, conservation and management.22/10/20101717.	The Offset Plan must be submitted for the approval of the Minister within 12 months of the commencement of gas field development.
