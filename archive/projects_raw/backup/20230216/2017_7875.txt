To compensate for the clearing of 57.03 hectares of Koala habitat and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat, the approval holder must:

Legally secure a minimum of 132 hectares at The Meads offset site prior to undertaking any clearing at the development area;
Within 20 business days of legally securing The Meads offset site, provide the Department with written evidence demonstrating that The Meads offset site has been legally secured (e.g. legal security documentation), and the shapefiles of the offset attributes;
Limit uses and permissible activities at The Meads offset site such that the value of The Meads offset site as Koala habitat and Grey-Headed Flying-fox foraging habitat cannot lawfully be reduced.30/11/202004Within 6 months from the date of this approval, the approval holder must complete baseline surveys of the entire area at The Meads offset site. The baseline surveys must be conducted by a suitably qualified field ecologist in accordance with a scientifically valid, robust, and repeatable methodology and include details of the:

Vegetation condition attributes for each Regional Ecosystem;
Number and condition of Grey-Headed Flying-fox foraging species in each quarter (25%) of The Meads offset site;
Extent of weed cover;
Number of non-native predators and non-native herbivores; and
Rate of Koala mortalities attributable to non-native predators.30/11/202005Within 3 months of completion of the baseline surveys required under condition 4, the approval holder must publish on the website and provide to the Department a report detailing the results of the baseline surveys required under condition 4 (including survey methodology and dates).30/11/202006For the protection of the Koala (and Koala habitat) and the Grey-headed Flying-fox (and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat), the approval holder must achieve the following outcomes at The Meads offset site by the end of year 1:

Repair and maintain the existing perimeter fencing to exclude all livestock from The Meads offset site;
Remove all barbed-wire fencing at The Meads offset site, excluding existing perimeter barbed-wire fencing; and
Increase the visibility to fauna of perimeter barbed-wire fencing, including by affixing visibility tags at every 30 cm interval along the top strand of perimeter barbed-wire fencing.30/11/202007For the protection of the Koala (and Koala habitat) and the Grey-headed Flying-fox (and Grey-headed Flying-fox foraging habitat), the approval holder must achieve the following outcomes at The Meads offset site by the end of year 8:

Restore vegetation condition to the ‘BioCondition Benchmarks to be achieved’ for each Regional Ecosystem, as specified at Attachment A;
Ensure that at least 6 different Grey-Headed Flying-fox foraging species (which in combination must provide annual winter and spring foraging resources for the Grey-headed Flying-fox) occurs within each quarter (25%) of The Meads offset site;
Ensure that the extent of weed cover across the whole of The Meads offset site is less than 5%;
A reduction in the numbers of non-native predators and non-native herbivores by 90%, relative to the numbers identified during baseline surveys; and
A reduction in the rate of Koala mortalities attributable to non-native predators by 90%, relative to the numbers identified during baseline surveys.30/11/202008Once achieved, environmental outcomes specified under conditions 6 and 7 must be maintained for the remainder of the period of effect of the approval.30/11/202009For the protection of the Spotted-tail Quoll present at The Meads offset site, the approval holder must ensure that any use of 1080 baits at The Meads offset site is undertaken in accordance with the Administrative Guidelines on the use of 1080.30/11/202010The approval holder must engage a suitably qualified independent expert to undertake an assessment of The Meads offset site at the end of year 4 to assess whether the outcomes required in conditions 6, 7 and 8 have been, or are likely to be, achieved. The findings of the assessment must be published within 6 months of the end of year 4 and be provided to the Department within 5 business days of being published.30/11/202011If, at any time during the period of effect of the approval, the Minister is not satisfied that any of the requirements or outcomes required under conditions 6, 7 and 8 have been or are likely to be achieved or maintained, the Minister may require the approval holder to submit a corrective action plan for The Meads offset site for the Minister’s approval, or to monitor, manage, avoid, mitigate, offset, record and/or report on, impacts to the Koala, the Grey-headed Flying-fox, or the Spotted-tail Quoll.

The Minister may set a timeframe in which the corrective action plan must be submitted, and may specify that the corrective action plan must be prepared or reviewed by an independent suitably qualified field ecologist.
If the Minister approves the corrective action plan, the approval holder must implement the approved corrective action plan.30/11/2020There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
