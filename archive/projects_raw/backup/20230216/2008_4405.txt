1. The proponent must prepare a Shipping Activity Management Plan ('the Plan') which includes:

for shipping activity within the geographic locations specified in sections 1.2 and 1.3 of the referral - provision for the protection of Dugongs (Dugong dugon); Green Turtles (Chelonia Mydas); Loggerhead Turtles (Caretta caretta); Flatback Turtles (Natator depressus); Water Mouse, (Xeromys myoides) and the seagrass species Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis, Halophila decipens, Halophila minor, Halophila spinulosa, and Zostera capricorni;
identification of the habitats, activities, and environmental tolerances in relation to the shipping activity associated with this referral for the species specified in condition 1(a);
to minimise environmental disturbance to the species mentioned in condition 1(a):

limits on vessel speeds, including speeds for particular vessel types;
limits on vessel movements, including the use of thrusters; and
limits on vessel light and sound.


a comprehensive outline of mitigation measures and controls for each of the types of shipping activities to minimise their impact on the species mentioned in condition 1(a), including actions to:

prevent and respond to the impact of accidental fuel, oil or chemical spills;
minimise the impact of marine discharges, including those associated with vessel cleaning, anti-fouling and waste disposal;
minimise disturbance to the seagrass species mentioned in condition 1(a);
minimise the impact of bow-wash on Water Mouse (Xeromys myoides) nesting sites; and
proposed remedial action in the event of any impacts directly attributable to the proponents shipping activities on the species specified in condition 1(a), and the habitats identified in condition 1(b), including a feasible and beneficial offsets strategy.


a comprehensive outline of monitoring arrangements to determine the impact of shipping activity on the species specifiedin condition 1(a), which includes:

recommendations on the timing and frequency of species surveys;
proposed monitoring arrangements; and
the nature and frequency of proposed reporting arrangements.22/10/2010There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.  Loading...
