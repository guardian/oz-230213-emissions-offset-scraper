The approval holder must submit an Offset Strategy for approval by the Minister for each Project Stage. The approval holder must not commence each Project Stage until the Offset Strategy for that Project Stage has been approved in writing by the Minister. The approval holder must implement the Offset Strategy approved by the Minister in respect of the relevant Project Stage.24/12/202031Each Project Stage Offset Strategy must propose offsets for that Project Stage and include the following:


details of how the proposed offsets align with the broader strategies and programs for the Great Barrier Reef, including but not limited to the Reef 2050 Long-term Sustainability Plan and will provide a net benefit to the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA);
details to demonstrate how the proposed offsets will compensate for significant residual impacts on the relevant protected matters in accordance with the principles of the Environmental Offsets Policy;
evidence of how the proposed offsets take into account relevant approved conservation advices, relevant recovery plans and threat abatement plans, or other relevant contributions to species recovery and conservation;
a process to update the Offset Strategy and confirm the offset requirements for protected matters based on the report prepared under condition 19;
a process for, at the minimum, a biannual review of the Offset Strategy and the performance of offsets for the period of effect of the approval including timeframes for conducting the reviews and for publishing the findings of each review on the website;
where direct offsets are proposed, offset information for each offset site must be provided in the offset strategy;
if indirect compensatory measures such as research are proposed, details of how the proposed offsets will be developed, the timeframe over which they would be undertaken and the expected outcomes of the compensatory measures. Indirect compensatory measures must be prepared in accordance with the Environmental Offsets Policy; and
if a financial contribution is proposed (e.g. for the amount of fine-grained sediment returned to the marine environment that was not previously available for resuspension before commencement of any Project Stage, and/or for lethal or sub-lethal impacts to seagrass and macroalgae), the Offset Strategy must:





explain the purpose of the financial contribution and demonstrate how it will result in a net benefit to the protected matter(s);
provide details of and justification for the organisation(s) to which a contribution will be made;
explain how the financial contribution will be calculated;
specify the proportion of the offset obligation that would be met by any financial contribution; and
specify the proposed amount of the financial contribution (where known).24/12/202038Project Stage 2 Envfronmental Offset Requirements
To compensate for the significant residual impacts on seagrass and/or macroalgae during Project Stage 2 as determined by the monitoring undertaken in accordance with Condition 12(a) the approval holder must provide an environmental offset consistent with the Environmental Offsets Policy. This offset must be in accordance with the approved Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy and implemented within 12 months from the date that the Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy is approved in writing by the Minister.24/12/202039To compensate for the quantum of significant residual impact through sub-lethal or lethal impacts to seagrass and/or macroalgae in the Project Stage 2 high and medium impact zones, as identified in accordance with condition 19(e), the approval holder must provide an environmental offset consistent with the Environmental Offsets Policy. This offset must be in accordance with the approved Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy and implemented within 12 months of submitting the report required under condition 19.24/12/202040To compensate for significant residual impacts during Project Stage 2 to Hawksbill Turtles and Olive Ridley Turtles, the following will apply:

If a monitoring program cannot be developed, as per condition 16, the approval holder must provide an environmental offset consistent with the Environmental Offsets Policy for the loss of Hawksbill Turtle foraging habitat and Olive Ridley Turtle foraging habitat as determined by the habitat extent and type monitoring required under condition 16(b). This offset must be in accordance with the approved Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy and implemented within 12 months from the date that the Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy is approved in writing by the Minister.
If an approved monitoring program can be developed and implemented (under condition 16), and significant residual impacts are identified to Hawksbill Turtles and/or Olive Ridley Turtles in the report required under condition 19(g), the approval holder must provide an environmental offset consistent with the Environmental Offsets Policy. The environmental offset must be consistent with the Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy and be provided to the Minister for approval within 12 months of submitting the report required under condition 19.24/12/202041If significant residual impacts to Loggerhead Turtles, Flatback Turtles and/or Australian Humpback Dolphins, are identified in the report required under condition 19(f), the approval must provide an environmental offset for these protected matters in accordance with the Environmental Offsets Policy. The environmental offset must be consistent with the Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy and be provided to the Minister for approval within 12 months of submitting the report required under condition 19.24/12/202042To compensate for any significant residual impacts of the action on protected matters, and to achieve a net benefit to the outstanding universal value of the GBRWHA, the approval holder must provide an environmental offset consistent with the Environmental Offsets Policy for the amount of fine-grained sediment returned to the marine environment that was not previously available for resuspension before commencement of Project Stage 2, as determined in accordance with condition 19(d). This offset must be in accordance with the approved Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy and implemented within 12 months of submitting the report required under condition 19.24/12/202043To compensate for significant residual impacts to Green Turtle foraging habitat, Dugong habitat and Australian Humpback dolphin habitat in Project Stage 2, the approval holder must provide an additional offset in accordance with Environmental Offsets Policy, unless the Minister is satisfied that the offset provided under conditions 38 and 39 will also compensate for impacts to these species. Any offset must be in accordance with the approved Project Stage 2 Offset Strategy and implemented within 12 months of submitting the report required under condition 19.24/12/2020There are no records to display.You don't have permissions to view these records.Error completing request.
